  Moksham is a powerful gateway to profound, transformative growth. The ecological, conscious community of Moksham located in Eastern Ghats of India, is a platform for a deep voyage into healing, self-acceptance, and expansion of consciousness.
  <br><br>
  The Moksham Community is also an intentional and alternative off-grid eco village where people live their normal lives in harmony with nature.
  <br><br>
  There is no belief system practiced in Moksham, rather a safe space is created for each fellow traveler to shed old layers, transcend limitations, and discover wholeness. The Six Pillars that hold this alternative way of life are Meditation, Emotional Healing, Physical Rejuvenation, Medicinal Ceremonies, Ecological Living, and Mystical Musical Journeys.
